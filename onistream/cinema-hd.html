            <h3 class="heading-c"><i>How to install Cinema HD on Roku TV</i></h3>
            <p>CinemaHD is an Android app, and Roku is not an Android-based device. So it's not possible to install the
                Cinema HD app directly on a Roku TV.</p>
            <p>However, you can use screen mirroring to display the content from your Android device on your Roku TV.
                Here are the steps to do so:</p>
            <ul class="ul-list-style">
                <li>
                    <p class="mb-0">Step 1: Turn on your Roku TV and make sure it's connected to the same Wi-Fi network
                        as your Android device.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="mb-0">Step 2: On your Android device, go to the Settings menu and select the "Connected
                        devices" or "Cast" option.</p>

                <li>
                    <p class="mb-0">Step 3: Select "Cast screen" or "Wireless display" option.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="mb-0">Step 4: Your Android device will scan for nearby devices. Select your Roku TV from
                        the list.</p>
                </li>
                <li>

            <p>Note that screen mirroring may not work smoothly on all devices, and the video quality may be affected.
                Also, the sound may not play through the TV, so you may need to connect external speakers for better
                audio.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-b"><strong class="highlight">Why is Cinema HD not working?</strong></h2>
            <p>There can be several reasons why CinemaHD App is not working on your device. Here are some common issues
                as well as their possible solutions:</p>
            <ul class="ul-list-style">
                <li><p>App not loading or crashing: If Cinema HD is not opening or keeps crashing, try clearing the
                        app's cache and data. To do this, go to your device's Settings menu, select "Apps &
                        notifications", find the app CinemaHD, and then select "Storage". From there, select "Clear
                        cache" and "Clear data". Then, try reopening it.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>No sources available: If you are getting a "No sources available" error, it could be because the
                        movie or TV show you are trying to watch is not available. You can try searching for a different
                        title or wait for the content to become available.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Buffering or low-quality video: If the video is buffering or the quality is poor, it could be due
                        to slow internet speed or high traffic on the server. You can try restarting your device or
                        connecting to a different network to improve the connection.</p></li>
                <li><p>Outdated app version: If you are using an outdated version of Cinema HD, it may not work
                        properly. Try updating the app to the latest version from a trusted source, such as the official
                        website or app store.</p></li>
                <li><p>Device compatibility issues: CinemaHD is designed to work on Android devices, and it may not be
                        compatible with all devices. If you are using a device that is not supported, the app may not
                        work at all or have limited functionality.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If none of these solutions work, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling the app or contacting the app
                developer for further support.</p>
